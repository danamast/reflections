What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When "git init" is used a new hide folder ".git" is created in the current directory.  The ".git" is first needed to for a place for git to track commits.

++

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like an intermediate area where all necessary files for a commit can be moved before making the commit.  This give a chance to organize the files first before they are committed. The working directory is like a sandbox where files can be manipulated.  The repository is a collection of all of these components plus the version history in the .git file

++

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By validating the status with the git status command every time a change is saved.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If there is a version that you want to keep ready for demonstration, for example, by placing it in a branch you could continue to work a other branches to further development but still have the one example ready for demonstration.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show not only where the common point is between branches, they show which commits are in which branch, and, importantly they show what is left dangling...

++

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging automatically follows the logic that a programmer would use to combine two branches.  This significantly helps in development since GIT will help manage these sometimes difficult process of merging two files from different developers.   The graphic diagram helps visualize the concept of paths or branch in development and show how the process has worked.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

pros - automatic merging helps very much in completing this often complicated task through the Git programs assistance.  Making it easier make the power branching process easier.

cons - If merge is done automatically sometime the subtel difference between the two merge branches can be missed.  There is a potential of propigating or creating a new problem with the automatic merging capability.
