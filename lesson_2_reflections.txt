What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When "git init" is used a new hide folder ".git" is created in the current directory.  The ".git" is first needed to for a place for git to track commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like an intermediate area where all necessary files for a commit can be moved before making the commit.  This give a chance to organize the files first before they are committed. The working directory is like a sandbox where files can be manipulated.  The repository is a collection of all of these components plus the version history in the .git file

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By validating the status with the git status command every time a change is saved.
