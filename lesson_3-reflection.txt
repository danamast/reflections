When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If work is being done on several computer (locations) then a web-based common location permits the file to be accessed from any of the computer.  Additionally, and probably most importantly, a remote repsoitory permits multiple developed to easily be working on common application or code set.  The remote repository can be accessed by any team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working locally, you may not be sure that changes that are on GitHub are what you want.  The resevers is also true, you may not want to push something automatically without thinking whether its the right thing to do.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is the easiest, a fork is a copy of a repsoitory on GitHub only.  It contains reference back to the original repository.  A branch is simply a break of of an existing repository.  A clone is copy either from a remote or from a local repository.  

++

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It gives a reference if or when changes are made by others.  It also permits working with the latest sync'd version if you are going to be off-line for a period of time while working on the software.

++

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be easier because you don't have to keep track of what's happening with version changes.  It would be harder because you don't have any capability to track where changes have occured

++

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have

If expimentation is being done with the code that may not be used in the final version or if there is a special version that is being created or if the version is moving in a different direction.
